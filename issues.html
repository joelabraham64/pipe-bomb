<h2>Paralign shutting off</h2>

1. Turn off/on the device
2. Switch the batteries
3. thats about it</pre>
    
<h2>No Plate</h2>
<pre>
1. Make your own plate
Just as long as it is in a stable place and is still parallel with the link roll you will be fine. 
You can check this by looking at the results tab on the Paralign Editor software</pre>
